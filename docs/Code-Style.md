# Code Style

When making code contributions to Loop, follow these guidelines:

- Strictly follow PEP8
- No comments unless it is critical to have it
- All functions (except `params`, `prep`, and `model` in SFMs) must have comprehensive docstrings
- All new functions must have tests
- All new functions must be documented
- Always use single quotes, except with f-strings where double quotes are always used
- Preference is one function per file
- For single function files, the name of the function and the file must be same
- Constants are always all caps, variables are always all lowercase
