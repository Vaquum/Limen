# Overview  
Add `mean`, `std`, `median`, and `iqr` to `data.HistoricalData.get_historical_klines` endpoint.
This will allow us to go beyond the current table columns available through that endpoint.

# Core Features  

- Extend `utils.get_klines_data` to return `mean`, `std`, `median`, and `iqr`
- Use `price` in the underlying raw trades data that is called from `tdw.binance_trades` on clickhouse
- Retain the exactly same pattern, where the logic is entirely handled in `utils.get_klines_data`

# User Experience  
- Researchers will now have more richer data available through `data.HistoricalData.get_historical_klines`

<PRD>
# Technical Architecture  
- You will have to understand what `data.HistoricalData.get_historical_klines` does
- You will have to make code changes in `utils.get_klines_data`

# Development Roadmap  
- Implement the change in branch `feat/add-stats-to-klines`
- Update the version
- Update the CHANGELOG.md with the current date

# Logical Dependency Chain
- This is a very clean change, all you have to do is update the SQL, and it will work

# Risks and Mitigations  
- The main risk here is introducing some bias or error to the way the data is pulled with SQL

# Appendix  
- NA
