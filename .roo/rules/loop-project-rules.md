# General Rules

- Never add fallbacks, we have strict preference for python error messages
- Always use type-hints
- Ignore any TODO you find

# Task Flow

Step 1: Use *Task Master* mode to decompose the task into clear, ordered sub-tasks.  
Step 2: Switch to *Sequential Thinking* mode and complete the sub-tasks one at a time.  
        - After each sub-task, briefly verify output and confirm prerequisites for the next.  
        - If a sub-task fails, pause and return to Task Master to re-plan just that branch.  
End: Return a final consolidated answer plus the task log.
